The Game, Draw it or Lose it, is a game that consists of 4 rounds of play lasting one minute each. 
Each player has an opportunity to guess to solve the puzzle before time expires approximately 30 seconds.
If the team guesses incorrectly, the opposing team has an opportunity to guess with 15 seconds.
Some of the requirements include having one or more teams involved. Each team will have multiple players.
Teams names must be unique with a feature checking to see if the team name is already in use. 
Only one game can exist in memory. Unique identifiers must be created. The application is based on
the already existent web version. In the attached document, you will find an effective outline for the 
system requirements. It provides all the functionality, tools, and methods to meeting all the requirements
of the client. In developing the code, the document provided an outline of what the client was looking for
which helps organize and streamline the coding process. If I had to pick a segment to revise, 
it would probably be the code. The code should be developed in the most efficient way. There 
could be some ways to clean up the code to make it more efficient. I intepreted the user needs 
by implementing them in the design in an efficient and effective way without compromising the
performance of functionality. It is important to identify the needs at the beginning to ensure 
that nothing is missed and additions/ ommissions can be addressed at the project progresses rather
than at the end. I approached designing the software in a way that meets the needs of the client 
and end user without sacrificing the functionality. The game is also compatible across multiple platformas.
In the future, I would make sure that the development team uses the best tools that create a product
in an effective but also efficient manner.
